        <h1>This is a polite website.</h1>
        <p>And it's perfect... just like you ;)</p>

        <h2>I mean, what else do you want?</h2>
        <p>You build sites that are are better than you think. You can 
            write a site that will put anyother site to shame.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>This site is lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your amazing screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your browsers</li>
            <li>This site is accessible to every visitor to your site</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Want to know something though:</h3>
        <p>you are more than likely overdesigning your site, with 
            a ton of memory.</p>
        <p>You never knew it, but this is the perfect site just html</p>

        <h2>It's lightweight baby</h2>
        <p>This entire page weight less that the facebook logo</p>

        <h2>It's responsive</h2>
        <p>You smart human, you dont't need media queries, Responsive means
            whatever screen size it is viewed on</p>

        <h2>It works</h2>
        <p>Look at this site, you can read it, its content on the screen that 
            you can read and all I am using is HTML5 and is even cross browser compatible</p>

        <h2>This is a website, have you never seen one before</h2>
        <p>like the man who's never grown a beard this site has no beard
            just very raw website.</p>
